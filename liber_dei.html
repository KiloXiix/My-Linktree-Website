        <p>This mod adds a single item to the game in the form of a book named Liber Dei. This book allows the player in possession of it to use any command currently available by simply typing it into the book and hitting Confirm. This book works whether cheats are turned on or off. The player doesn't even need to have operator permissions in order to use the book either since it's the book itself that is running the commands you type in it.</p>
        <p><h3>Words of Advice:</h3></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Commands will not work if you put the "/" before them since it's technically already there but hidden.   Ex: You can't type "/kill @p"     You have to type "kill @p"</li>
            <li>Commands must be specific as they have to have a target to work.  Ex: You can't do "kill"   you have to do "kill @e",  "kill [Player Name]", "kill @p",  etc...</li>
            <li>The book also does not let other players know when you use a command in the chat like normal commands do</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>For The (Balanced) Versions:</h3></p>

        <ul>
            <li>To make the book more balanced, files that have the word "(balanced)" in the name now mean that the book is single use only which means: <b> 1 Book = 1 Command</b></li>
            <li>If you want to keep the book after opening just leave the text field blank when you click confirm or hit ESC, otherwise it will be consumed</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>


        <p><h3>FAQ:</h3></p>
        <p>Can you make this (Version)?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently I can only update the version higher. Whatever the highest version of the mod is out, it won't go lower than that</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Can you change the Recipe to this ___?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While I can change the recipe, I need to come up with a decent recipe I like first before I change it so recipe ideas are welcome.</li>
        </ul>
